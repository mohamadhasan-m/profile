I am currently studing Mechanical Engineering at MSc. degree in [University of Terhan](https://ut.ac.ir), 
working jointly with [Dr. Saadat](https://sites.google.com/berkeley.edu/mohsen-saadat/home?authuser=1), and [Dr. Shirazi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=xq0kymMAAAAJ&hl=en). I received my BSc. in Mechanical Engineering from [University of Isfahan](https://ui.ac.ir), under the supervision of [Dr. Karimpour](http://eng.ui.ac.ir/~h.karimpour), and [Dr. hasanpour](https://engold.ui.ac.ir/~hasanpour/).

My research interests are I) **Robotics and Mechatronics** with applications in haptic interface devices, II) **Artificial Neural Networks and Computer Vision** with applications in human body pose estimation, and III) **Dynamic modelling and Control** with applications in attitude control and tracking systems.

I enjoy working with hardwares. In fact, I have worked with [STM32](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32-32-bit-arm-cortex-mcus.html), [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/), and [Jetson Nano](https://developer.nvidia.com/embedded/jetson-nano-developer-kit) in my projects.
I think there is no such things more satisfying than creating a device that can do a particular task. In short, *I like to make!*
