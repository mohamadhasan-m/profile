If your windows command prompt doesn't open, try these:

1- Add this path to the environment variables (User):

    C:\Windows\SysWow64\
    
then reboot your system.

2- Open PowerShell with administrator and write this command:

    sfc /scannow

then reboot your system.

3- Go to Registry Editor and delete *Autorun* in the following path:

    Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Command Processor
